			<p>Dear Hiring Manager(s):</p>
	
			<p>I am writing to express my interest in the <b>Cyber Threat Intelligence Intern</b> position with your Malware and Cyber Threats Team for the <b>June to August</b> session. I am currently a Computer Science undergraduate finishing up my second sophomore semester at PennWest Edinboro and will be residing in Pittsburgh from the beginning of May to the end of August.</p>
			
			<p>In the past few years, I have practiced many different web technologies relating to <b>full-stack development</b> both in and out of school. I have worked on applications that require a comprehensive understanding of both <b>visual design</b> and <b>backend</b> technologies, giving me a holistic perspective when it comes to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in online platforms. I have recently finished a course in database management using PostgreSQL that has helped me integrate protocols like SSH and online services like Heroku. I particularly enjoy working with JavaScript and Python frameworks like Django for my own projects.</p>
			
			<p>During this period in my life, I am looking to absorb pragmatic, ethical cyber practices that will carry my work into the future. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to delve deeper into researching the dark web and related cyber threats for this reason. NCFTA's program would expose me to a <b>collaborative development environment</b> that would allow me to utilize tech research/development to tackle real-world issues.</p>
			
			<p>Thank you for considering my application. I hope you can see my candidacy for this role and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.</p>
			
			<p>
				<i>Best regards,</i><br>
				Shawn Gallagher
			</p>
