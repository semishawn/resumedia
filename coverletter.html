			<!-- <p>Dear Hiring Manager(s):</p>
	
			<p>I am writing to express my interest in your general <b>Web Design and Development Intern</b> position for a <b>Summer 2024</b> term. I am currently a <b>Computer Science undergraduate</b> finishing up my second sophomore semester at <b>PennWest Edinboro</b> and will be residing in Pittsburgh from the beginning of May to the end of August.</p>

			<p>In the past six years, I have practiced many different technologies relating to <b>full-stack development</b> both in and out of school. I have worked on applications that require a comprehensive understanding of both <b>visual design</b> and <b>backend</b> systems, giving me a holistic perspective when it comes to internet content creation. I am able to harness <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b> (including libraries like React and jQuery) to create the team a unique interface within <b>WordPress</b> or in conjunction with PHP CMS/database systems like <b>Joomla</b>. To craft the brand's image, I am familiar with visual design tools such as <b>Adobe Photoshop</b> and <b>Illustrator</b>, although a lack of disposable income has necessitated a preference for open-source software like <b>Krita</b> and <b>Inkscape</b>.</p>
			
			<p>During this period in my life, I am looking to absorb pragmatic, creative technologies that will carry my work into the future. I highly respect Carnegie Mellon's computer department and NREC's program would expose me to a <b>collaborative work environment</b> that would allow me to practice my web development strategies in a professional context.</p>
			
			<p>Thank you for considering my application. I hope you can see my candidacy for this role.</p>
			
			<p>
				<i>Best regards,</i><br>
				Shawn Gallagher
			</p> -->
