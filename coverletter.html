			<p>Dear Hiring Manager(s):</p>
	
			<p>I am writing to express my interest in your <b>Machine Learning Research Intern</b> position for a <b>summer</b> term. I am currently a <b>Computer Science undergraduate</b> finishing up my second sophomore semester at <b>PennWest Edinboro</b> and will be residing in Pittsburgh from the beginning of May to the end of August.</p>

			<p>In the past six years, I have practiced many different technologies relating to <b>full-stack development</b> and <b>databasing</b> both in and out of school. I have worked on applications that require a comprehensive understanding of both <b>visual design</b> and <b>backend</b> systems, giving me a holistic perspective when it comes to programming. While my expertise predominantly lies in web development, I am interested in leveraging my foundation in software engineering to explore the realm of machine learning. I have enjoyed working with JavaScript frameworks and Python libraries like Keras for personal projects in this area.</p>
			
			<p>During this period in my life, I am looking to absorb pragmatic, ethical technologies that will carry my work into the future, not just in the tech-sphere but also in sectors like health and linguistics. I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to delve deeper into researching modern transformers and chemistry models like those used by Neocortex for this reason. PSC's program would expose me to a <b>collaborative research environment</b> that would allow me to utilize machine learning to tackle real-world issues.</p>
			
			<p>Thank you for considering my application. I hope you can see my candidacy for this role and I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.</p>
			
			<p>
				<i>Best regards,</i><br>
				Shawn Gallagher
