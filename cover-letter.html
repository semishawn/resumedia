			<p>Dear Hiring Manager(s):</p>
	
			<p>I am writing to express my interest in your <b>Software Engineer Intern</b> position for Summer 2025. I am currently a <b>Computer Science</b> undergraduate, starting my junior Spring semester at <b>Pennsylvania Western University, Edinboro</b>.</p>

			<p>I was first introduced to Cloudflare when Googling “how to add jQuery to HTML”. <b>Cdnjs</b> had been a mainstay in my programming repertoire for years before I decided to peak behind the curtain and investigate the network structure. I became particularly drawn to Cloudflare’s speed performance and serverless functionality, which I have come to utilize wholesale in my web projects. During the past five years, I have studied software development from a <b>visual</b>, <b>backend</b>, and <b>cloud</b> perspective, and through my university program I have completed a Data Structures course focusing on <b>Python</b>, a Structured Programming course utilizing <b>C++</b>, two <b>Java</b> courses, a Database Design course, and a Computer Graphics course, among others. I have extensive experience working with full-stack web development, including “QoL” <b>JavaScript</b> libraries and more complex frameworks like <b>ReactJS</b> and <b>Electron</b>. I have also recently experimented with <b>Rust</b> on small-scale Linux projects, and hope to sharpen my skill in practicum.</>
			
			<p>During this period in my life, I am looking to absorb pragmatic, creative technologies that will carry my work into the future. I highly respect Cloudflare’s internet services, and an internship program would expose me to a collaborative work environment that would allow me to practice my web development strategies in a professional context.</p>
			
			<p>Thank you for considering my application. I hope you can see my candidacy for this role.</p>
			
			<p>
				<i>Best regards,</i><br>
				Shawn Gallagher
